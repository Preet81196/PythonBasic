I am not perfect but I am limited edition.
Wherever I go, I meet myself.
I recreate myself; that is my only power.
One hand I extend into myself, the other toward others.
I put myself in the way of things happening, and they happened.
I Am In Love With Myself, With My Heart.
I speak less because I know there are very few who likes to listen ……
Of course love is blind; it keeps me blind to myself.
What others think of me is none of my business.
This is who I am. Nobody said you had to like it.
I’m the most awesome person I know.
I didn’t change, I just found myself.
Because I love myself, I listen to myself.
I am who I am. Your approval is not needed.
God has entrusted me with myself.
I never loved another person the way I loved myself.
I just hate talking about myself.
I refuse to give up myself.
I restore myself when I am alone.
Me against myself.
I am learning to love myself. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done.
